# Privacy Policy for StudySmart

**Last updated:** January 19, 2026

StudySmart (“**StudySmart**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) is a mobile app owned and operated by **Ryan Lawrence** (“Owner”). This Privacy Policy explains what information StudySmart collects (if any), how information is used, and what happens when you use StudySmart’s AI-assisted features.

If you have questions, see **Contact Us** at the end of this policy.

---

## Quick Summary (Plain English)

- **No accounts.** StudySmart does not require sign-up or login.
- **No StudySmart servers.** Your course material, generated study guides/quizzes, and quiz results are stored **locally on your device**.
- **No analytics or tracking by us.** We do not run tracking pixels, ad tech, or analytics that identify you.
- **AI features send content to OpenAI.** If you use AI-assisted study features, the text you provide (and related prompts) is sent from your device to **OpenAI** to generate outputs. We do not receive or store that content on our own servers.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to StudySmart and its public website:
- https://ryanalawrence.github.io/StudySmart-Public

This policy does **not** cover third-party services you may use in connection with StudySmart (for example, your app store or the AI provider). Those services have their own privacy policies.

---

## Information We Collect

### 1) Information you provide to StudySmart
**We do not collect information you provide into the app on our servers.** StudySmart is designed so that:
- Your **course materials**
- AI-generated **study guides**, **flashcards**, or **quizzes**
- Your **quiz results** and progress

…are stored **locally on your device**.

### 2) Information collected automatically
StudySmart does **not** operate analytics SDKs, tracking cookies, or similar telemetry to collect personal data.

**Important note:** your device, operating system (iOS/Android), mobile carrier, or app marketplace (Apple App Store / Google Play) may collect certain information independently (such as crash logs, download metrics, or diagnostics). That collection is controlled by those parties, not by StudySmart.

## How AI Features Work (OpenAI)

StudySmart offers optional AI-assisted features that can turn your coursework into study materials and quizzes.

### What is sent to OpenAI
When you use AI features, StudySmart sends to OpenAI:
- the course material or text you provide (or select),
- instructions/prompts needed to generate study content,
- and the immediate context needed to create the requested output.

### What we do with that content
- **We do not store your AI input or output on StudySmart-owned servers.**
- The content is sent directly from your device to OpenAI and returned to your device.

### OpenAI’s processing
OpenAI may process the content you send in order to provide the AI response. OpenAI may also receive **technical data** necessary to deliver the service (for example, IP address and basic request metadata). Their handling of data is governed by OpenAI’s own privacy and usage terms.

### Model training
We do **not** use your content to train our own models. For OpenAI, StudySmart is intended to use OpenAI services in a way that does **not** permit training on your submitted content. (For the most accurate, current details on OpenAI’s data use, review OpenAI’s published policies.)

---

## Cookies and Tracking

StudySmart does not use cookies, ad identifiers, or third-party tracking technologies in the app.

Our GitHub Pages website may be subject to GitHub’s standard logging and policies (e.g., basic access logs). We do not control GitHub’s infrastructure logging.

---

## How We Share Information

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information because we do not collect it on our servers.

The main “sharing” involved in StudySmart is:
- **You → OpenAI (AI requests):** content you submit to generate study materials is transmitted to OpenAI for processing.

We may disclose limited information if we are legally required to do so (for example, to comply with a valid legal process), but again, we do not maintain user accounts or store user content on our servers.

---

## Data Retention

- **On your device:** Your materials and results remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app.
- **On our systems:** We do not retain your course material, generated content, or quiz results on StudySmart-owned servers because we do not operate such storage for this app.
- **With OpenAI:** Retention (if any) is determined by OpenAI’s policies and your use of their services through the app.

---

## Security

We take reasonable steps to protect data in transit and at rest:

- **In transit:** StudySmart transmits data to/from AI providers using **encryption in transit** (e.g., HTTPS/TLS).
- **On device:** StudySmart data is stored **encrypted at rest** on the user’s device (subject to the device’s OS encryption and your device security settings such as passcode/biometrics).

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we aim to minimize risk by keeping content on-device and encrypting communications to the AI provider.

---

## Your Choices and Controls

Because your data is stored locally:
- You can delete materials within the app (if that feature exists), or
- Delete the app to remove its local data (subject to your device’s backup settings).
- You can choose not to use AI features if you do not want your content sent to OpenAI.

---

## Children’s Privacy

StudySmart is intended for students and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because StudySmart does not require accounts and does not collect personal information on our servers, our collection is minimal by design. If you believe a child has provided personal information to OpenAI through use of the AI features, please contact us and we will do our best to help you understand your options.

---

## California Privacy Notice (CCPA/CPRA)

StudySmart does not collect, sell, or share personal information on its own servers. As a result, many CCPA/CPRA provisions (such as access or deletion requests for server-stored data) may not apply in the typical way.

If you have questions about how the AI provider handles data sent through the app, consult the AI provider’s privacy policy.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top and post the new version at:
- https://ryanalawrence.github.io/StudySmart-Public
